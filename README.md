# Comeo-public

I using this project to summary all of my new technology of android development
This project using MVVM pattern, Livedata, Coroutine, Retrofit, ...

# Social Application
Android social network application implemented using the MVVM pattern, Kodein, Retrofit , LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room. Comeo control data from the API Server to provide information.

## Architecture: Clean architecture

### Data-Flow
![Structure](https://github.com/xuanlocle/Comeo-public/blob/1.0.7/data-flow.png?raw=true "Data flow")

### Work-Flow
![Structure](https://github.com/xuanlocle/Comeo-public/blob/1.0.7/work-flow.png?raw=true "Work flow")

#### Domain Layer
- Contains business model 
- Contains business RULEs
- Repository interface adapt 

#### Data Layer
- Implementation Repository
- Executor API data
- Storage data to local: Share preferences, database, external storage 
- Mapper data model to domain model
- Contains data service, third party data service  

#### Presentation Layer relies and complies with the following points below:
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Kodein](https://kodein.org/di/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Paging3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview?hl=vi) which helps to load more newfeed.
